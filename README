Ludwig - a lattice Boltzmann code for complex fluids

The ./docs directory contains the manual in tex form, and as
a pdf (try "cd docs"  and "make pdf"). This includes a guide
for compilation and running the code.

Quickstart: copy a config file from the config directory to
the top level directory and make any changes required. E.g.,

$ cp config/lunix-gcc-default.mk config.mk
$ cd tests
$ make compile-mpi-d3q19

This will produce an execuatable ./src/Ludwig.exe
