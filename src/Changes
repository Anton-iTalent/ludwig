Changes

Log file for changes to the code.
=================================

2006 May 30 kevin

* I have rearranged the order of the velocity set in d3q15.c
  so that it is in Sean's optimal order (equivalent to that
  used in d3q19.c). This means the propagation routines are
  slightly simplified. In addition, cv now satisfies
  cv[p] = -cv[NVEL-p] for p > 0, so BC_Map[] can be dispensed
  with in BBL.

* Removed a number of minor used code segments.

* I have rearranged the fluctuation code so that the sheer and
  bulk viscosity can be varied independently. This also means
  that the single fluid collision now has separate relaxation
  times for sheer and bulk modes (like the binary fluid collision).

* I have encapsulated the viscosity and the fluctuation "temperature"
  kT in model.c. All gbl objects are still scheduled for deletion.

* A number of minor changes to address missing function prototypes.


2006 May 12 kevin

* I have moved all d3q15 dependent code to the new file d3q15.c
  (including the propagation and the ghost modes). Likewise, all
  d3q19 stuff is in d3q19.c. This means the site variable is
  declared in d3qnn.h.

* D3Q19 ghost noise has been added.

* The single-fluid collision has been moved to model.c, and
  single.c removed.

* I've removed the variables gbl.eta and gbl.noise in favour
  of encapsulated versions in model.c. All gbl objects are
  scheduled for deletion.
