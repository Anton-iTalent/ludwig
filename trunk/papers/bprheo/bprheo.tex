\section{Model and Methods}

Our approach is based on a well-established model for hydrodynamics of cholesteric liquid crystals \cite{Beris:1994,Olmsted:1999} that describes the order structure of the liquid crystal by a traceless, symmetric tensor order parameter ${\bf Q}({\bf r})$. 
In uniaxial approximation the tensor order paramter is given by $Q_{\alpha \beta}=\langle n_\alpha n_\beta - 1/3\; \delta_{\alpha\beta}\rangle$, whereas ${\bf n}$ represents the local orientation of the liquid crystal molecules and brackets indicate mesoscopic averaging over a large number individual molecules.
Its largest eigenvalue $\frac{2}{3}q$ with $0<q<1$ characterizes the degree of order around the corresponding axis. 
The equilibrium properties of the system are determined by a Landau-de Gennes free energy density $f$ and the functional ${\cal F}[Q]=\int d^3{\bf r} f({\bf Q})$.
The free energy density consists of two different parts, namely a bulk contribution $f_b$ and a gradient term $f_g$.

\begin{eqnarray}
f_b&=&\frac{A_0}{2}\left(1-\frac{\gamma}{3}\right) Q_{\alpha \beta}^2-\frac{A_0 \gamma}{3}Q_{\alpha \beta} Q_{\beta \gamma} Q_{\gamma \alpha}+\frac{A_0 \gamma}{4}(Q_{\alpha \beta}^2)^2\nonumber\\
f_g&=&\frac{K}{2}(\varepsilon_{\alpha\gamma\delta} \partial_\gamma Q_{\delta\beta}+2 q_0 Q_{\alpha \beta})^2+\frac{K}{2}(\partial_\beta Q_{\alpha \beta})^2\label{eqn1}
\end{eqnarray}

The first term contains the bulk-free energy constant $A_0$ and the inverse temperature $\gamma$ and features a the first-order transition from the isotropic to the ordered phase at $\gamma>2.7$.
The second part comprises the elastic contributions to the free energy due to splay-, bend- and twist-deformations and assume for simplicity that they have all the same elastic constant $K$.
The pitch length $p$ of the cholesteric liquid crystal is related to the wavervector $q_0=2\pi/p$.
In order to specify a thermodynamic state it is useful to introduce two dimensionless quantities, the effective temperature $\tau$ and chirality $\kappa$.
They are given by 

\begin{eqnarray}
\tau&=&\frac{27(1-\gamma/3)}{\gamma}\nonumber\\
\kappa&=&\sqrt{\frac{108 K q_0^2}{A_0 \gamma}}\nonumber,
\end{eqnarray}

whereas the chirality qqnatifies the ratio between gradient and bulk free energy.\\
The equation of motion of the tensor order parameter reads

\begin{equation}\label{}
\left(\partial_t+ u_\alpha \partial_\alpha \right){\bf Q} - {\bf S}({\bf W},{\bf Q}) = \Gamma {\bf H}.
\label{eqn2}
\end{equation}

The first term on the lefthand side of Eq.(\ref{eqn2}) is a material derivative, which describes the rate of change of a quantity moving along with the flow.
The second term accounts for the rate of change due to velocity gradients $W_{\alpha \beta}=\partial_\beta u_\alpha$:

\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf S}({\bf W}, {\bf Q}) &=& (\xi {\bf A} + {\boldsymbol \Omega})({\bf Q}+\frac{\bf I}{3})\nonumber\\
& &\hspace*{-1.5cm}+ ({\bf Q}+\frac{\bf I}{3})(\xi {\bf A}  - {\boldsymbol \Omega})-2 \xi ({\bf Q}+\frac{\bf I}{3})Tr({\bf Q W}),
\label{eqn3}
\end{eqnarray}

where $Tr$ denotes the trace operation and ${\bf A}=({\bf W}+{\bf W}^T)/2$ and ${\boldsymbol \Omega}=({\bf W}-{\bf W}^T)/2$ are the symmetric and antisymmetric part of the velocity gradients, respectively.
The molecular details of the liquid crystal such as the aspect ratio of its mesogens are embodied in the constant $\xi$, also know as the tumbling parameter.
The righthand side relates the rate of change to the molecular field, which is a functional derivative of $\cal F$ that preserves the tracelessness of $\bf Q$.

\begin{equation}
{\bf H}=-\frac{\delta {\cal F}}{\delta {\bf Q}}+\frac{\bf I}{3}\, Tr\left(\frac{\delta {\cal F}}{\delta {\bf Q}}\right).
\label{eqn4}
\end{equation}

The rotational diffusion constant $\Gamma$ is proportional to the inverse of the rotational viscosity $\gamma_1=2 q^2/\Gamma$.\\
The time evolution of density and velocity are goverend by the continuity equation Eq. (\ref{eqn5}) 

\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_t \rho + \partial_\alpha (\rho u_\alpha)=0
\label{eqn5}
\end{eqnarray}

and the Navier-Stokes equation Eq. (\ref{eqn6})

\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_t u_\alpha +\rho \,u_\beta \partial_\beta u_\alpha&=&\partial_\beta \Pi_{\alpha \beta}\nonumber\\
&+&\hspace*{-2cm}\eta\, \partial_\beta \{ \partial_\alpha u_\beta + \partial_\beta u_\alpha +(1+3\frac{P_0}{\partial \rho} )\partial_\mu u_\mu \delta_{\alpha \beta})\}. 
\label{eqn6}
\end{eqnarray}

At low flow rates the fluid can be considered as incompressible, so that the last term on the righthand side of Eq. (\ref{eqn6}) can be safely neglected.
The pressure tensor reads explicitely

\begin{eqnarray}
\Pi_{\alpha \beta}&=&P_0-\xi H_{\alpha \gamma}\left(Q_{\gamma \beta} +\frac{1}{3} \delta_{\gamma \beta}\right)-\xi \left(Q_{\alpha \gamma} +\frac{1}{3} \delta_{\alpha \gamma}\right) H_{\gamma \beta}\nonumber\\
&+& 2 \xi  \left(Q_{\alpha \beta} +\frac{1}{3} \delta_{\alpha \beta}\right) Q_{\gamma \nu} H_{\gamma \nu}-\partial_\alpha Q_{\gamma \nu} \frac{\delta{\cal F}}{\delta \partial_{\beta} Q_{\gamma \nu}}\nonumber\\
&+&Q_{\alpha \gamma}H_{\gamma \beta}-H_{\alpha \gamma} Q_{\gamma \beta}.
\label{eqn7}
\end{eqnarray}

It comprises the terms that give rise to an additional stress in the ordered state.
In the isotropic state when ${\bf Q}\equiv 0$ Eq. (\ref{eqn7}) is reduced to the scalar pressure, which is constant to a very good approximation.\\ 
The system of coupled partial differential equations is solved by means of a hybrid scheme \cite{Denniston:2004, Marenduzzo:2008} that uses a lattice Boltzmann algorithm with predictor-corrector scheme for the hydrodynamic equations (\ref{eqn5}) and (\ref{eqn6}) and a finite difference scheme for the tensor order parameter equation (\ref{eqn2}).


\section{Results and Discussion}

In the following we report our results of simulations of the bulk flow behaviour of cubic BPI and BPI.
The thermodynamic states characterized by $\tau=-0.5$ and $\kappa=1.0$ (BPI) and $\kappa=2.0$ (BPII), respectively.
For these parameters both blue phases are equilibrium phases in the quiescent state.
Simulations of metastable states at higher temperatures and different chiralities showed the same generic behaviour.
The only observable quantitative difference was that networks closer to the cholesteric-isotropic phase boundary with typically higher free energies and lower average order parameter proved more unstable with respect to the external driving forces.\\
The order parameter was initialized with an analytical solution of Eq. \ref{eqn1} in the limit of infinite chirality which has already the correct topology of the blue phase.
These initial configurations were then equilibrated for $5000$ LB time steps, where we also allowed for the a priori unknown 'redshift' of the pitch, the optimization of the unit cell size (cf. \cite{Alexander:2006}).
After equilibration the unit cell size was kept constant throughout the rest of the runs with the shear flow switched on.
In order to guarantee that complex configurational changes in the blue phase networks are properly resolved we opted for a unit cell size of 16 lattice sites in case of BPII and increased the unit cell size to 32 sites in case of BPI. Runs with higher resolution confirmed that this is an appropriate minimal resolution to cover all kinematic details of the network.

In order to impose a flow profile we used Lees-Edwards boundary conditions \cite{Wagner:2002}, whereas the top (bottom) half of planes moved in positive (negative) y-direction.
We applied a correction for spurious momentum currents that emerge due to interpolations accross the Lees-Edwards planes \cite{Henrich:2011b}.
The imposed flow rates ranged over two orders of magnitude from about $1.25\cdot 10^{-6}$ to $6\cdot10^{-4}$ in LB units.\\
In the visualizations that follow the orientation of the principal coordinate axes in x-, y- and z-direction always coincides with the direction of the velocity gradient direction, the flow and the vorticity, respectively.
Disclination lines are plotted as isosurface of the scalar order parameter $q$

\subsection{Blue Phase II}

We start the discussion with BPII, because its flow behaviour is simpler and probably more easily anticipated.
Fig \ref{fig11} shows the disclination network undergoing a flow-induced transformation.
The periodically recurring structure remains very regular and apart from the quasi-affine transformation relatively close to its quiescent appearance with individual disclination lines breaking up and reconnecting further downstream.

\begin{figure*}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{disc-160k_run902.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{disc-164k_run902.png}

\caption{Disclination network of BPII in shear flow: The pictures show a typical sequence of shear-induced transformations in the steady state at $\dot{\gamma}=1.56\e{-4}$ and time steps $t=1.60, 1.64,1.65\e{5}$. The velocity gradient is oriented along the vertical direction, whereas the horizontal direction is the flow direction. The flow takes place in such as way that network moves to the right in the upper half and to the left in the lower half.}
\label{bp2-med}
\end{figure*}

Interestingly, while being steadily sheared in y-direction, the entire disclination network is slowly displaced in z-direction, the direction of vorticity.
This feature is most clearly observed when the structure is viewed along the flow direction.

Fig. \ref{fig3} shows characteristic regions of upward and downward 'flow', which are normally superimposed by the primary shear flow in y-direction.
Remarkably, the secondary flow is directly connected to the sense of the underlying cholesteric helix as changing from left- to right-handed helix also inverts the sense of motion of the network.

The lefthand picture depicts the situation the movement of the disclination network is downwards, while helix inversion leads to an upward motion in the righthand picture.
More precisely the orientation of the velocities with respect to the bands is exactly inverted in both cases. 

A closer look at the shape of the disclination lines reveals that also the network seems to be inverted. 
The total magnitude of the secondary flow is in the range of a few percent of the primary flow and the images in Fig. \ref{fig3} give actually the situation close to the peak point.\\ 

A secondary flow pattern with distinctive regions of positive and negative velocity components $v_z$ emerges and reoccurs periodically.

Flow occurs in such a way that the network moves into (out of) the paper plane in the upper (lower) half of the images.}
\label{bp2-velo}
\end{figure*}


It is interesting to study the flow behaviour from a more quantitative point of view by looking at the shear stress dependence on flow rate and time. 

The effective viscosity $\eta_{eff}$ over time is shown in Fig. \ref{fig4}. 
For all apart from the highest flow rate it oscillates sinusoidally, exhibiting symmetric minima and maxima and decreasing mean values, indicating slightly shear-thinning behaviour.
The period reflects the time it takes for the disclination network to break up and reconnect as shown in Fig. \ref{fig11}.
However, due to the motion of the network in z-direction it turns out that it takes four periods altogether for the network to move one unit cell along the direction of vorticity and to complete one cycle.
The inset shows the deviatoric part of the chemical stress tensor as a function of shear rate.
The dependence is that of a power law $\sigma_{eff, xy}=a \dot{\gamma}^b$ with $a=0.34(6116), b=0.95(2654)$ for low and intermediate shear rates. 
The error bars indicate the maximum and minimum stress during one cycle.
The idependence is almost linear and gives further evidence of the remarkably small degree of shear-thinning and also reflected in the very regular and undisturbed affine transformation of the disclination network.

\label{bp2-rheo}
\end{figure}

Above a critical shear rate, which is $\dot{\gamma}=3.1-6.2\cdot 10^{-4}$ in our case, the rotational diffusion coefficient $\Gamma$ in Eq. \ref{eqn2} is too small and the disclination network adopts a completely different conformation in the steady state.
Fig. \ref{fig5} shows the director field and the position of disclination plane.
The degree of twist is the same as that of the underlying cholesteric, but the orientation of the director on either side of the planes differs by almost 90 degrees, giving rise to four distinct layers, which are separated by disclination planes.
Even in this flow-induced state the disclinations move and retain the above described sense of motion in the direction of vorticity.

\subsection{Blue Phase I}

The flow behaviour of BPI deviates significantly from that of BPII in a number of points.
First of all it takes considerably longer to reach the steady state with periodically recurring patterns.
This might be because the disclination network of BPI undergoes much more complex flow-induced transformations than that of BPII.
Fig. \ref{fig6} shows a sequence of typical conformations at the same shear rate as Fig. \ref{fig11}, but this time seen along the direction of flow.
A similar affine transformation in flow-gradient plane takes place, which is however obscurred by the transformations shown here. 
The initial and final state in this sequence correspond to half a cycle. 
This can be easily verified by comparing the position of the disclination network at the left or right boundary.
BPI and BPII have exactly the same recurrence period, although it is seemingly four times shorter if the travelling of the network in z-direction is not taken into account.  

\begin{figure*}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{disc-365k_run914.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{disc-367k_run914.png}

The horizontal direction is the vorticity direction, whereas the velocity gradient is oriented along the vertical direction.}
\label{bp1-med}
\end{figure*}

The disclination network and the x- and z-component of the flow velocity are depicted in Fig. \ref{fig7}.
Just as in the previous case of BPII inverting the helix in the initial configuration inverts the sense of motion of the network in z-direction.
Equally it leads to an inversion of the velocities, shown here for a particular time steps, but due to the different topology and the complicated conformational changes there is no simple band structure as previously observed for BPII. 

\begin{figure*}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{v_yz-v_z-360k_run914.png}

Flow occurs in such a way that the network moves into (out of) the paper plane in the upper (lower) half of the images.}
\label{bp1-velo}
\end{figure*}

Despite qualitative similarities between the BPI and BPII, the quantitative analysis reveals striking differences.
In Fig. \ref{fig8} we show the effective viscosity $\eta_{eff}$ over time and flow curves $\sigma_{chem}(\dot{\gamma})$. 
BPI exhibits pronounced shear-thinning contrary to BPII, whereas the shape of the curves in no longer symmetric.
In fact on approaching the critical shear rate that led in the case of BPII to the disruption of the network, the curves become increasingly complex but remain fully periodic.
The effective viscosity drops by about an order of magnitude between the lowest and the highest shear rates.
Note that the scale has been adapted to allow for the different magnitudes.
The inset can be directly compared with that of Fig. \ref{fig4}.
Interestingly the difference between minima and maxima of the chemical shear stress is much larger than for BPII and for the lowest shear rate we applied the absolute minimum takes even negative values, which are not shown in Fig. \ref{fig4}.
Our understanding of this phenomenon is an interplay of the elastic forces and the individual order paramter configuration of the liquid crystal.
If the system is close to a local minimum of the free energy but moving away from it the increasing strain pumps elastic energy into the system. 
This results in positive chemical stresses as the system tries to withstand the deformation.
However, if the system has sufficiently transformed and is about to overcome a local maximum, it will be pulled towards the next local minumum, which can lead temporarily to negative chemical stresses. 
The inset shows that the chemical stress decreases monotonically with decreasing flow rate, but does not follow a simple power law dependence.
 
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{stress_bp1.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{stress_vs_strain_bp1.pdf}
\caption{Effective viscosity $\eta_{eff}=\Sigma_{xy}/\dot{\gamma}$ of BPI over time (left) and strain (right). The inset shows the flow curve $\sigma_{chem}(\dot{\gamma})$.}
\label{bp1-rheo}
\end{figure}

A Fourier analysis of the time series of the deviatoric chemical stress $\sigma_{eff,xy}$ or alternatively the free energy density $f$ can provide a further insight into the flow behaviour of BPI.
Fig. \ref{fig9} shows the Fourier spectrum of the time series of the chemical stress.
For simplicity we have always doubled the shear rate, so that the first overtone ocoalesces with the fundamental mode of the next highest shear rate. 
At low shear rates we observe a strong contribution of the first harmonic, which is directly related to the recurrence period $T$, shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$ and unit cell size $l_{u}$ via $\omega_0=2\pi/T=2\pi/(l_{u}\dot{\gamma})$.
The magnitude of higher harmonics decreases monotonously with increasing frequency.
Interestingly the inset of Fig. \ref{fig9} shows that at intermediate shear rates the contribution of higher harmonics becomes more pronounced until after a kind of gap and similar break up the fundamental mode dominates again and the former characteristics are restored.
Remarkably the break up in case of BPI occurs in exactly the same flow rate window as BPII.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.495\textwidth]{spectrum_bp1.pdf}
\caption{Spectrum of the time series of the chemical stress over time. The frequency is given in units of $10^2\cdot 2\pi/T$ whereas $T$ is the recurrence period in LB time steps.}
\label{bp1-spec}
\end{figure}

Nevertheless, the disclination network and order parameter strucutre of both phases looks strikingly different in this high flow rate state.
Fig. \ref{fig10} shows a snapshot along the gradient direction and the direction of vorticity.
Contrary to BPII BPI forms rolls which are advected by the flow and undergo a simple affine transformation similar to that of BPII below the break up point.
They meet in $\pm\pi/2$ disclinations, which are oriented along the z-direction.
