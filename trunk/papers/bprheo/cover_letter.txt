Dear Editor,

we would like to submit the attached manuscript,
'Rheology of Cubic Blue Phases' for consideration for 
publication in Soft Matter.

We believe our work is suitable for the following reasons:

We study the behaviour of cubic blue phases under shear flow 
via lattice Boltzmann simulations. We focus on the two 
experimentally observed phases, Blue Phase I (BPI) and 
Blue Phase II (BPII). The disclination network of Blue Phase II 
continuously breaks and reforms under steady shear, leading to 
an oscillatory stress response in time. For larger shear rates, 
the structure breaks up into a cholesteric helix, lying either 
along the vorticity or the flow gradient direction according to 
the imposed flow. BPI leads to a very different response. Here, 
oscillations are only possible for intermediate shear rates â€“ 
very slow flow leads to a transition into an amorphous network 
with an apparent yield stress. The flow-induced oscillation 
regime features a novel arrangement of double helical disclinations 
which rotate due to the shear. Large flow rates can, just as in 
the BPII case, lead to the rupture of the network and the 
stabilisation of less ordered cholesteric structures. 

Our results provide the first theoretical investigation of sheared 
blue phases in large systems, and are relevant to understanding 
the bulk rheology of these materials. We therefore believe our work 
should be of broad interest to soft and condensed matter 
physicists, as well as to theoreticians and experimentalists 
working in liquid crystal physics.

With best wishes,
