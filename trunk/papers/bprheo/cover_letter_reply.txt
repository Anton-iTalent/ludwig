Dear Editor and Referee,

We would like to submit the attached manuscript  ID SM-ART-01-2013-050228 
'Rheology of Cubic Blue Phases' as revised version for publication in Soft Matter.

After the earlier version of the manuscript had already been recommended 
for publication by the referees we discovered a major problem in our code 
that needed further investigation. It turned out that a contraction of 
two tensors had been implemented incorrectly (the last term in Eq. 5 containing
the trace operation). From the nature of this problem it was clear that 
this would have an effect on order-flow coupling and might cause deviations 
from our previous results at larger flow rates.

We have regenerated all simulation data and verified the code against 
an alternative implementation of the same model down to the level where
numerical differences between both codes could be related to different 
implementations of boundary conditions, bounce-back and discretisations.

Fortunately, the majority of our results did not change. This is particularly
true for very low shear rates, where the above mentioned coupling between order
and flow is small, and at very high shear rates, where the director field in the
steady state is stationary (Grandjean texture) and does not induce time-dependent 
changes in the order parameter structure.

Another positive aspect of this revision was that the entire rheological picture
became somewhat simpler and more consistent. There is generally more consistency 
between BPI and BPII and differences between simulations at different system sizes
vanished completely.

In the following overview we use these abreviations:

THW travelling helical wave
PRC periodically recurring conformations
AN  amorphous network
GJ  Grandjean texture
FGJ frustrated Grandjean texture
FAN flow-alinged nematic state

Things that have changed are

- regime BPII-3 in the old version (THW): is a metastable flow state and is not 
directly reached as steady state after the revision.
- regime BPI-3 in the old version: is replaced with PRC, AN, FGJ and GJ
- BPI-4 (newly found conformation in the old version): is metastable and is not 
directly reached as steady state after the revision.
- 2uc/3uc/4uc comparison: discrepancies between both simulation sizes disappeared.

Things that remained unchanged are

- BPI-1: formation of amorphous network at low shear rates due to large stress oscillations
- BPII-1: weak shear thinning at very low and up to intermediate shear rates
- existence of regimes with PRC (BPII-1, BPI-2) at intermediate shear rates
- existence of a regime with 'rheochaos' at Ericksen numbers Er O(1)
- breakup into GJ at Ericksen numbers Er ~ 5-15
- formation of FAN at Er ~ 20

Many thanks for considering our manuscript for publication in Soft Matter

Kind regards,
Oliver Henrich (on behalf of our collaboration)
