{\bf Supplementary Methods}

\noindent
\textbf{Parameter details for bulk BPI.}
The parameters for the free energy are chosen to be representative
of blue phase I: chirality $\kappa \sim 0.7$ and reduced temperature
$\tau = -0.25$.
The full free energy parameters are shown in Table~\ref{table:params}.
The order parameter tensor $Q_{\alpha\beta}$ for bulk blue phase I is
initialised from an approximation in high chirality limit
\cite{blue1,oliver1}. Systems of 128$^3$ lattice sites are
used with a pitch length of $p = 32\sqrt{2}$, which accommodates 4$^3$
unit cells with fully periodic boundary conditions.
Simulations at different solid volume fractions (1\% and 4\%), and different 
surface anchoring strengths ($WR/K = 0.23$ and $WR/K = 2.3$) representing
``weak'' and ``strong'' anchoring are run for two million simulation
time steps.
The initial distribution of the colloid positions is set at random
for the required solid volume fraction; the colloids are initially
at rest.

To generate a disordered network of disclination lines, a ``quench''
is performed in which the order parameter is initialised via a
locally chosen random director, and
%Eq.~\ref{eq:surf_q} MAIN TEXT Q_0 = .... 
Eq.~15
employed with a small amplitude $q^0 = 10^{-7}$ to
provide an order parameter.
The mean-field spinodal point at $\gamma = 3.0$ is avoided and
the parameters are the same as for the initial simulations with
pitch $p = 32\sqrt{2}$. The chirality and reduced temperature (see
Table~\ref{table:params}) remain appropriate for BPI.
Colloids are added as before and the simulations run for 2 million
simulation steps.

For simplicity,  the size of the BPI unit cell is not allowed to 
readjust dynamically to minimise free energy (there is no 
``redshift''~\cite{blue1}): this would lead to quantitatively different 
values of the free energy, but qualitatively similar structures. 

\noindent
\textbf{Parameters for confined BPI.}
Here, a narrow sandwich of fluid is placed between flat walls in
perpendicular to the narrow coordinate direction, and with periodic
boundaries in the other two directions. The system size used in all
cases is 256$^2 \times$56 lattice sites. Each simulation is a ``quench''
in a similar manner to that used in the bulk: the order parameter is
initialised randomly. The free energy parameters (see Table~\ref{table:params})
are again appropriate for (equilibrium) blue phase I
(chirality $\kappa = 0.8$ and
reduced temperature $\tau = -0.25$). The cholesteric pitch is set
to be $p = 64$, providing a slightly better resolution than the bulk
simulations.

The surface anchoring for colloids is as before: always normal, but with
$WR/K = 0.23$ and $WR/K = 2.3$. The colloid solid volume fractions are
1\% and 4\%.
For both normal and planar anchoring at the walls,
the strength is adjusted to correspond to that used for the strongly
anchoring particles.
All simulations are run for two million simulation time steps.

\noindent
\textbf{External electric field.}
For the simulations of BPIII with colloidal particles a system size of
$128^3$ is used with a cholesteric pitch of $p=32$ in lattice units. 
The simulations are
performed at chirality $\kappa=2.6$ and reduced temperature $\tau=-0.25$.  
An initial configuration of
randomly oriented and positioned double twist cylinders is used,
from which an amorphous BPIII network emerges \cite{oliver-bp3}. This structure
is equilibrated for $6\times10^{5}$~LB time steps until no significant
further evolution is observed. 

The colloidal particles with weak
normal anchoring ($WR / K= 0.23$), are then inserted with randomly chosen positions,
and the composite system is equilibrated for another $1.2\times10^{6}$
time steps.
At the end of the equilibration phase the uniform electric field
with reduced field strength ${\cal E} = 0.8$ 
is switched on (oriented along the $z$-direction), and the simulation
run for a further $1.2\times10^{6}$ time steps.
This is found to be sufficiently long for a hexagonal structure to
emerge and saturate.
If the electric field is then switched off, and the system quickly relaxes
to a metastable state which shows a residual anisotropy in the
colloidal distribution. The total length of this final relaxation phase
is $1\times10^6$ LB time steps.

\noindent
\textbf{Disclination rendering.}
In all cases visualisation of the defect lines is carried out via
an isosurface of the scalar order parameter~$q$ determined from the
largest eigenvalue of the local order parameter tensor. A low value
of the scalar order parameter~$q$ (typically in the range~0.12--0.14)
unambiguously identifies the disclinations.

\noindent
\textbf{Computation of the structure factor.}
To provide structural information about the field-aligned 
states and the residual anisotropy after switch off a 
procedure similar to the one described in \cite{oliver-bp3} is
followed.
The structure factor $S(\mathbf{k})$ in the current approach is
defined via the Fourier transform of the colloid density $F(\mathbf{k})$:
\begin{equation}
S({\bf k}) =  |F({\bf k})|^2, \mathrm{with}\
F({\bf k}) = \int d^3{\bf r} \rho({\bf r}) e^{i {\bf k. r}}.
\end{equation}
The colloid density $\rho({\bf r})$ is a discretised density and taken to be
$\rho({\bf r})=1$ if a lattice site at ${\bf r}$ is part of a colloid
and $\rho({\bf r})=0$ otherwise. This definition, which deviates from the 
standard definition of a structure factor and does not consider the colloids 
as point-like objects, allows the same structural information
to be obtained in a simple way.

\noindent
\textbf{Parameter mapping to physical units.}
To get from simulation to physical units, a calibration of scales of
length, energy and time in the simulations is required. For similar
mappings see,
e.g.~\cite{denniston2}.

The length scale can be set by mapping the half pitch to a realistic blue
phase unit cell size, which is in the 100--500~nm range \cite{blue1}. 
For bulk simulations (Fig.~1 and Fig.~3 in the main text), a suitable choice
is one where one simulation unit (lattice site) corresponds to 10~nm. Therefore
the colloidal size in Figs.~1 and~3 corresponds to $\sim$ 50~nm. 

To obtain an energy scale, it is possible to choose $A_0 \simeq 10^6$~Pa,
which is reasonable following Ref.~\cite{blue1} (this is also the choice in
Ref.~\cite{oliver2}). This choice leads to a simulation unit of
free energy (or stress) equal to $10^{8}$~Pa in Figs.~1 and~3.
From the energy and length scales one can map elastic constants to
physical units: for instance, the simulation in Fig.~1 corresponds to
a liquid crystal with splay, bend and twist (Frank) elastic constants
equal to 35 pN (or equivalently $K=70$~pN).

The timescale calibration may be obtained from (see e.g.~\cite{denniston})
\begin{equation}
\gamma_1=\frac{2q^2}{\mathit{\Gamma}},
\end{equation}
which relates the rotational viscosity $\gamma_1$ to the ordering strength
$q$ and the order parameter mobility $\mathit{\Gamma}$.
In the present simulations, $\mathit{\Gamma} = 0.5$ and the value of $\gamma$
for the simulation in Fig.~1 leads to $q=1/2$.   
For real liquid crystalline materials, $\gamma_1$ usually lies in range
$10^{-2}-1$ Pa s~\cite{deGennes}; for definiteness say
$\gamma_1 = 1$~Pa~s (equivalently 10 poise). Given the previous mapping for
free energy (or stress) units, this leads to a simulation unit of time equal
to $10^{-8}$~s. The total simulated time in Figs. 1-3 is therefore in the
millisecond range. 

To calibrate the electric field strength 
one can equate the value of the dimensionless parameter ${\cal E}$ in the 
simulations with that of a hypothetical experiment.
Given the previous value for $A_0$, and a dielectric anisotropy of 20
(or equivalently $\epsilon_\mathrm{a}=20\epsilon_0$, with $\epsilon_0$ the
dielectric permittivity of vacuum), an electric field
of 100 V~$\mu$m$^{-1}$ is obtained. This corresponds to a value of
${\cal E}\sim 0.4$ (considering a value of $\gamma=3.0857$ as in
Fig.~3 of the main text).

Given these mappings, all quantities can be easily transformed from
simulation to physical units and vice versa. For example Figs.~1 and~2
use an isotropic viscosity $\eta \simeq$~0.01 and~0.1 in simulation units,
which translate into $0.01-0.1$~Pa~s respectively. This is sensible (if 
slightly low) for a molecular nematogen in the isotropic phase. 
The effective viscosity in ordered phases is higher, but this is ensured
in our model by the coupling to the order parameter.
Note that the density is set to unity in the simulations: this
corresponds to a fluid density which is about a thousand times larger
than in experiments. This makes no difference in practice as
the Reynolds number $= \rho V\Lambda/\eta$ (where $V$ is a typical
velocity, in our simulations around $10^{-5}$ in lattice units, 
and $\Lambda$ is a typical length scale, e.g. the size of a unit cell) 
remains small enough~\cite{codef}. 

To summarise, the simulations represent BP-forming materials, with the
interpretation of the simulation units for length, time, and energy
density being close to 10~nm, 10~ns, and 100~MPa respectively.
For a Frank eleastic
constant of $K = 70$~pN and unit cell sizes in the range
$\lambda =$100--500~nm, a corresponding shear modulus $G \simeq
K/\lambda^2 =$ 0.3--7~kPa.
