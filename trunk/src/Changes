Changes

Log file for changes to the code.
=================================

2006 June 6 kevin

* I have removed the remaining gbl objects. The rho/phi related
  elements are encapsulated in model.c

* All the I/O related stuff has been moved to communicate.c.
  Eventually, I expect this to be split into halo related
  stuff and lattice I/O related stuff.

* I have removed all the original run time input processing
  code in favour of the runtime interface. IMPORTANT: as a
  consequence, there is no run time input for colloid parameters
  which are hard set in COLL_init(). This will be updated.

* cio.c: I have removed a lot of the Global_Colloid stuff from
  the colloid I/O as this makes it extremely unweildy. A better
  method for keeping restart state needs to be found.

* colloids.h: various unused struct elements removed from
  Global_Colloid. This struct is going to be removed (it's
  undesirable global state). 

* interaction.c: the order parameter gradient calculation has
  been (correctly) reinstated.

* I have rearranged the order of the velocity set in d3q15.c
  so that it is in Sean's optimal order (equivalent to that
  used in d3q19.c). This means the propagation routines are
  slightly simplified. In addition, cv now satisfies
  cv[p] = -cv[NVEL-p] for p > 0, so BC_Map[] can be dispensed
  with in BBL.

* Removed a number of minor used code segments.

* I have rearranged the fluctuation code so that the sheer and
  bulk viscosity can be varied independently. This also means
  that the single fluid collision now has separate relaxation
  times for sheer and bulk modes (like the binary fluid collision).

* I have encapsulated the viscosity and the fluctuation "temperature"
  kT in model.c. All gbl objects are still scheduled for deletion.

* A number of minor changes to address missing function prototypes.


2006 May 12 kevin

* I have moved all d3q15 dependent code to the new file d3q15.c
  (including the propagation and the ghost modes). Likewise, all
  d3q19 stuff is in d3q19.c. This means the site variable is
  declared in d3qnn.h.

* D3Q19 ghost noise has been added.

* The single-fluid collision has been moved to model.c, and
  single.c removed.

* I've removed the variables gbl.eta and gbl.noise in favour
  of encapsulated versions in model.c. All gbl objects are
  scheduled for deletion.
