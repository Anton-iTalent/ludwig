Dear Editor and Referees,

We would like to submit the attached manuscript  ID SM-ART-01-2013-050228 
'Rheology of Cubic Blue Phases' as revised for publication in Soft Matter.

After the earlier version of the manuscript had already been recommended 
for publication by the referees we discovered a major problem in our code 
that needed further investigation. It turned out that a contraction of 
two tensors has been implemented incorrectly. This would have an effect 
on order-flow coupling and caused simulations for larger flow rates 
to deviate from our previous results.

We have regenerated all simulation data and verified the code against 
an alternative implementation of the same model up to the level where
deviations between both codes could be tracked down to different implementations
of boundary conditions, bounce-back or different discretisations.

Fortunately, the majority of our results did not change. This is particularly
true for very low shear rates, where the above mentioned coupling between order
and flow is small, and at very high shear rates, where the director field in the
steady state is constant and does not induce time-depending changes in the 
order parameter structure.

Another positive aspect of this revision was that the entire rheological picture
became somewhat simpler and more consistent.

There is generally more consistency between BPI and BPII and 
between simulations at different system sizes

Things that changed are

- BPII-3 (THW): is a metastable flow state and is not 
directly reached after the revision
- regime BPI-3 (rheochaos): is replaced with PRC, ARC or metastable flow states (MS)
- BPI-4 (newly found conformation): is presumably metastable (?) and is not 
directly reached after the revision
- 2uc/3uc comparison: discrepancies between both unit cell sizes disappear

Things that remained unchanged are

- BPI-1: formation of amorphous network at low shear rates
- BPII-2: weak shear thinning at intermediate and down to the lowest shear rates
- existence of regimes with PRC (BPII-1, BPI-2) at intermediate shear rates 
- existence of a regime with ARC at Ericksen numbers Er O(1)
- breakup into GJ at larger flow rates Er ~ 5-15 ?
- formation of FAN at Er ~ 20
