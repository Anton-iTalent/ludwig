absolutely clear.


Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author):

Point 1:

We stress that the appropriate Fournier and Galatola formulation
for planar generate anchoring *is* used [existing reference 44]
where necessary, and this is in addition to the normal anchring
described by Eq. 7.

We have updated two sections of text to make this absolutely
explicit and to avoid confusion.

a. On page 10 [highlighted in blue] we have rewritten the text
accompanying Eq. 7:

"In the case of normal anchoring, the surface free energy density
(per unit area) is
$f_s = ...$,
where $Q^0_{\alpha\beta}$ is the preferred order parameter tensor
at the solid surface, and $W$ is a constant determining the strength
of anchoring. In the case of planar anchoring a slightly
more complicated expression is required to allow for degeneracy
(see, e.g., [Fournier and Galatola]). The determination of ..."

b. On the first page of the supplement, we replace

"For both normal and planar anchoring at the walls, the value of W is the
same as that used for the strongly anchoring particles." 

by

"For both normal and planar anchoring at the walls,
the strength of anchoring is adjusted to correspond to that used for
the strongly anchoring particles."


Point 2:
We have added the statements requested with some textual changes
to aid clarity and continuity in the main text.


A statement on annealing has been added on page 5 (highlighted in red):

"It may be possible to anneal the structures obtained via the quech route,
although we have not attempted this in simulation. The results presented
suggest that even when starting with colloidal particles randomly dispersed
in an ordered blue phase, the particles are able to distort the structure
(Fig.~1A-B). This suggests that it would be difficult to identify a quench
protocol which would lead to less, rather than more, disorder."

A statement on electric field is added on page 7 (highlighted in red):

"We note that for the fluid parameters used here, the field induced
changes are irreversible with the weakly anchoring colloid particles.
The mesophase without colloid particles undergoes
a reversible ordering transition~\cite{bp3}; the reversibility is
retained in the presence of particles only if their anchoring is
very weak."
